Here lies the code we used to perform the experiments in the dissertation 'On the robustness of nuclear segmentation models in digital pathologyâ€™.

This was a challenging project, and took considerable work to get the testing and evaluation working for HoVer-Net (See the utils.py). As a result, we did not have sufficient time to adequately document the code. We have included two files to show how to evaluate and train models using the code in Evaluation_Instructions.pynb and Training_Instructions.pynb.

The code in this toolbox builds heavily off https://github.com/alexjfoote/reetoolbox and https://github.com/vqdang/hover_net.
