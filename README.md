# REET2.0
REET2.0 is the Robustness Evaulutation and Enhanchement Toolbox (https://github.com/alexjfoote/reetoolbox.git) extended to include nuclear semantic segmentation models and nuclear instance segmentation models.

The toolbox takes algorithms from robustness analysis and combines them with digital pathology augmentations, aiming to produce the most challening clincial conditions that computational pathology CNNs are likely to face. For a detailed understanding of the algorithms developed for the toolbox, see [Dissertation.pdf](Dissertation.pdf)
