# REET2.0
REET2.0 is the Robustness Evaulutation and Enhanchement Toolbox (https://github.com/alexjfoote/reetoolbox.git) extended to include nuclear semantic segmentation models and nuclear instance segmentation models.

The toolbox takes algorithms from robustness analysis and combines them with digital pathology augmentations, aiming to simulate the most challening clincial conditions that computational pathology CNNs are likely to face. The toolbox can use these algorithms to evaluate the clinical robustness of nuclear segmenation models and provide performance metrics for given clinical variations. For a detailed understanding of the algorithms developed for the toolbox, see [Dissertation.pdf](Dissertation.pdf).
